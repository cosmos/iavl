// ProofOperator is a layer for calculating intermediate Merkle roots
// when a series of Merkle trees are chained together.
// Run() takes leaf values from a tree and returns the Merkle
// root for the corresponding tree. It takes and returns a list of bytes
// to allow multiple leaves to be part of a single proof, for instance in a range proof.
// ProofOp() encodes the ProofOperator in a generic way so it can later be
// decoded with OpDecoder.
