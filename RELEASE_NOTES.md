This release follows the Cosmos-SDK semantic version tagging philosophy. Read more [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/RELEASES.md#semver-dependencies).

This release contains an API breaking change. The Cosmos-SDK will release an update to 0.47 and 0.50 in the coming weeks to satisfy the API breaking changes.

This release is not consensus breaking.
