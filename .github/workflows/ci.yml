        # Some tests, notably TestRandomOperations, are extremely slow in CI
        # with the race detector enabled, so we use -short when -race is
        # enabled to reduce the number of slow tests, and then run without
        # -short with -race disabled for a larger test set.
        #
        # We still run the same tests, just on smaller data sets with -short.
        #
        # We also do a 32-bit run, even though this is executed on a 64-bit system.
        # This will e.g. catch constant overflows and such.
