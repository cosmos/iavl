        # Some tests, notably TestRandomOperations, are extremely slow in CI
        # with the race detector enabled, so we use -short when -race is
        # enabled to reduce the number of slow tests, and then run without
        # -short with -race disabled for a larger test set. The same tests
        # are run, just with smaller data sets.

        # We also do a 32-bit run. Even though this is executed on a 64-bit
        # system, it will use 32-bit instructions and semantics (e.g. 32-bit
        # integer overflow).
